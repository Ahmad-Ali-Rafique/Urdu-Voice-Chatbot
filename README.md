# Urdu Voice Chatbot - Streamlit

Welcome to the Urdu Voice Chatbot project! This repository showcases a Streamlit application that allows users to interact with a chatbot using Urdu voice input and receive responses in Urdu.

## üöÄ **Project Overview**

The Urdu Voice Chatbot is designed to:
1. **Record Urdu Voice Input**: Users can record their voice in Urdu using the integrated audio recorder.
2. **Convert Voice to Text**: The recorded voice is transcribed into Urdu text using Google's Speech Recognition API.
3. **Generate AI Responses**: The transcribed text is processed by Gemini‚Äôs Generative AI model to generate a relevant response.
4. **Convert Text to Voice**: The generated response is then converted back into Urdu speech using Google's Text-to-Speech (TTS) API.
5. **Interactive Interface**: The Streamlit interface provides a user-friendly way to interact with the chatbot.
